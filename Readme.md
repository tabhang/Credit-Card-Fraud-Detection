# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Adversarial Network

## Overview

This project implements an Adversarial Network for credit card fraud detection using deep learning techniques. The Adversarial Network consists of a generator and discriminator, leveraging synthetic data generation to enhance the performance of the fraud detection model.

## Key Features

- **Adversarial Network Architecture:**
  - Implementation of a neural network architecture with a generator and discriminator for fraud detection.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - In-depth data preprocessing techniques, including normalization of data.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Evaluation of the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).

## Results

- **Precision and Recall (Fraudulent transactions):**
  - Achieved a precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.81 for fraudulent transactions (Class 1), demonstrating the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying actual fraud cases. 

- **AUPRC:**
  - Demonstrated a high AUPRC of 0.847, emphasizing the model's precision-recall balance.
